## 👋 Hi there!

I'm a passionate and highly skilled frontend developer — possibly one of the best you'll meet 😉.

### 🚀 What I work with:
- **React** — my daily bread and butter  
- **Fluent UI v9** — for beautiful, accessible design systems and it offers the best react library architecture I have ever seen 
- **PCF (PowerApps Component Framework)** — extending Power Platform with custom controls  
- **.NET Framework** — because great frontend often needs solid backend support

### 💡 What I love:
I thrive on **analyzing problems** and crafting elegant solutions.  
Building **tools and frameworks for other developers** is my definition of *god-tier software development* — done right, it has the biggest impact.

### 🤝 How I work:
I **always contribute back** — if I uncover something while digging into the internals, you can expect me to share exactly what I found and, whenever possible, fix it myself. Open source is better when we all pitch in!

Let’s build something awesome! 🚀
